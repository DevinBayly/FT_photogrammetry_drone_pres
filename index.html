# Fort Huachuca Project: Background

* Supporting students and PI from Digital Humanities
* Reconstructing the east range 
* ~145km^2 ( yikes! )
* Wingtra one (no ppk)
* 1cm resolution
* \>60k images
* Open Drone Map
* Desired outputs 
    * DEM & Ortho
    * Pointcloud (.laz)
    * 3d textured models
    * VR assets
    * OGC 3d Tiles
    * (different departments want different outputs)
* [project repo](https://github.com/DevinBayly/FT_photogrammetry)
    * includes qgis and odm scripts
    * under development

---
# Fort Huachuca Project: Workflows

* WebODM on HPC (vanilla)
    * Converted Docker Compose to Singularity instances
    * ElGato 16 core 12 hour instance, 200-800 images success
    * pro:
        * using OOD remote desktop can teach students to use
    * con:
        * manual submission will not scale to image numbers we have

---
# Fort Huachuca Project: Workflows

* ODM Split Merge Cluster (sm-cluster)
    * [support doc](https://docs.opendronemap.org/large/)
    * Setup 8 worker nodes
    * put their configuration info in cluster-odm
    * launch cluster-odm
    * launch odm container with `--split 200` `--sm-cluster http://localhost:3000`
    * pro:
        * can  point at entire folder of images and start processing programmatically
    * con:
        * Image products depend on flight pattern (long and narrow feature artifacts more than square tile)
        * unpredictable OOMs and allocation time limits exceeded
        * no all image products can be merged (no 3d)
---
# Fort Huachuca Project: Workflows

* QGIS group segmentation SLURM HPC ODM
    * establish tiled overlapping groups of images from the different flights
    * export a large JSON with those groups
    * Implement a python script that launches HPC tasks (12-16 hours) aimed at processing each group separately
    * leverage .las information for aligning the 3d models
    * pro:
        * reliably completes without OOM, and/or timeouts
    * con: 
        * hard on the presentation end of the pipeline
---
# Fort Huachuca Project: Difficulties

* Missing files
    * Experiencing a lot of problems filling in sections of map
* Storage issues
    * 10TB runs out fast
* ODM requires a lot of parameter education
    * missing manual helps with this


---
# Closing thoughts

* ODM is a great program with a very active community, recommend experimenting with it
* Reach out to me for any assistance with getting compute access 
* Visualization and DCC project support
* Acknowledgment
    * Tyson Swetnam Jeff Gillan
    * Support from Piero Toffanin
